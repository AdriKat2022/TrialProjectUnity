# Game Development Trial Project
Welcome to my game development trial project! This repository contains my implementations of the required tasks, demonstrating my skills in project setup, workflow management, gameplay mechanics, systems development, and maybe even custom editor tools.  
This project uses the Unity [6000.0.24f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) version.

## üìù Overview
This trial consists of 4 tasks designed to prove my skills and train multiple areas of game development over 5 days.  
The tasks will evaluate:

- Project planning & estimation  
- Version control & workflow management  
- Problem-solving & critical thinking  
- Implementation of game mechanics & systems in the Unity engine

This project will follow a structured approach with proper documentation and respect a comprehensive commit history.
